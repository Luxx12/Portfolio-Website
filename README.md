Gabriel Barreto Otero - Portfolio Website
A minimalist portfolio website with a bright, desert-inspired aesthetic featuring an abstract dune landscape and right-side navigation. Built with React and Tailwind CSS.
Design Philosophy
The site uses a bright desert minimalism approach with warm ambers, soft oranges, and stone tones on light backgrounds. The design features an abstract SVG-based dune landscape on the home page, creating an artistic and flowing atmosphere. Navigation is fixed to the right side in a vertical layout.
Key design elements include generous spacing for clean, airy layouts, light typography with extralight and light font weights, and wide letter spacing throughout. The site is divided into three main sections: Home with the abstract desert background and profile information, Journey with a clean timeline using colored dot markers, and Projects displaying work in bordered cards with semi-transparent backgrounds.
