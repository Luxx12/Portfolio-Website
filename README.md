## üé® Changing Colors

The site uses a Dune-inspired desert color palette. To customize the accent colors:

**Main Accent Color (currently amber/orange):**
- Find `amber-` throughout the code (e.g., `text-amber-600`, `border-amber-800`)
- Replace `amber` with other warm Tailwind colors:
  - `orange` (Warmer desert tones)
  - `yellow` (Lighter sand tones)
  - `stone` (More neutral, cooler)
  - `neutral` (Even more neutral)
  - `slate` (Cooler, bluish grays)

**Example Changes:**
- Navigation underline: `border-amber-500` ‚Üí `border-orange-500`
- Section headers: `text-amber-600` ‚Üí `text-yellow-600`

**Background Adjustment:**
- Current: `bg-stone-950` (warm black)
- Alternatives: `bg-neutral-950` (neutral black), `bg-slate-950` (cool black)

**Typography:**
- Font weight is intentionally light (`font-light`, `font-extralight`)
- Letter spacing is wide (`tracking-wide`, `tracking-widest`)
- Keep these for the minimalist aesthetic

**Pro Tip:** The Dune aesthetic relies on subtlety - keep opacity low (e.g., `/30`, `/40`, `/60`) for borders and accents to maintain the refined, minimalist look.
